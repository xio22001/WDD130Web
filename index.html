    <h2>Dan</h2>
    <p>Hello Everyone, My name is Daneng Xiong but I go by Dan most of the time.
    I'm happy to be here and to learn programming. It's been quite the journey in my life and somehow I found myself here back in school for a career change.</p>
    <p>I've spent most of my adult life working in the financial service industry but I've always found computers and technology interesting so I've made up my 
    mind to become a programmer. So far so good. Recently I just picked up the guitar and piano so I'm learning those as well.</p>
    <p>I am also a big fan of MMA particularily UFC and ONE championship. I've seen just about every Pay Per view that the UFC has put on. 
    Maybe that's a little too much, lol. Anyway, I look forward to learning more python in this class and to meet new friends..</p>
