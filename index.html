    <h2>Dan</h2>
    <p>Hello Everyone, My name is Daneng Xiong but I go by Dan most of the time.
        I'm happy to be here and to learn web developement. It's been quite the journey in my life and somehow I found
        myself here back in school for a career change.</p>
    <p>I've spent most of my adult life working in the financial service industry but I've always found computers and
        technology interesting so I've made up my
        mind to become a programmer. So far so good. Recently I just picked up the guitar and piano so I'm learning
        those as well.
        I am a convert to the church. I served a mission in Minnesota from 1995 to 1997. Currently I'm serving as a
        Group Leader in my ward.
        My wife and I were sealed in the Oakland temple and we have 3 children.</p>
    <p>I am also a big fan of MMA particularily UFC and ONE championship. I've seen just about every Pay Per view that
        the UFC has put on.
        Maybe that's a little too much, lol. Anyway, I look forward to learning more web development in this class and
        meet new friends.
        Feel free to connect with me on social media.
    </p>
