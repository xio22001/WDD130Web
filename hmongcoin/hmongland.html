    <h2>Hmong Land</h2>
  </center>  
    <p>Hmong people have always dreamed of having a country they can call their own. Now you can have the whole Earth as your country in the digital world. Lets face the facts, if you are using the same currency to trade and you can trade with any Hmong person around the world, what difference does it make that you have to live on one land. Its already as if you live on one land because you can communicate and trade with one another. You can call the Earth as Hmong Land if you want, we are all connected now with Hmoob coin. </p>

        <p> In a world where governments are controlled by corporations and greed runs rampant in every country, is there any hope that the Hmong will have their own country someday. We think not, all the major lands and real estate has already been bought and owned. We find it somewhat ludicrous to say that the Hmong will have their own country someday like what some of the older Hmong generation wishes. We are however very respectful of the older Hmong generation. We do understand that it has always been a dream of the Elders to have a country called home, and to keep that dream alive there needs to be HOPE. For this reason, we have created Hmong Land. Hmong Land will keep that Hope alive. Hmong Land is the virtual land of the Hmong and anyone can access it through any VR headset. In Hmong Land, you can experience what it was like to live in the old traditional Hmong way. See the bamboo trees and witness the sun setting over beautiful green mountain tops. You can hike along a dirt path going up the hill and then as you look down, you eyes will swell with joy as you witness the beautiful green rice fields slightly bending against the gently blowing wind. Welcome to Hmong Land.</p>
