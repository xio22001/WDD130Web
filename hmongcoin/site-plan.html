      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Welcome to Hmongworld.org
        The history of the Hmong people dates back 8000 years ago with the last know Hmong King Chi Yu.
        King Chi Yu was one of 3 Legendary founding fathers of China. His efforts on uniting the Hmong people failed as the other two Kings formed an alliance and defeated him. Hmong people were scattered across Asia with many fleeing to the southeast.
        This website is to pay homage to King Chi Yu and finally unite the Hmong people across all lands.
        Currently there’s 4 to 5 million Hmong around the world. Most of the population is in Asia with about 5% Hmong in the United States.
        The first step for unification is with the use of Hmoob Coin. Hmoob Coin can be used exclusively with Hmongworld.org and the Hmong world ecosystem. 
        On this website you can buy, sell or trade with other Hmong people across the globe.
        The spirit of King Chi Yu, invites all Hmong across the world to unite and get your free Hmoob coin today right here at Hmongworld.org.
