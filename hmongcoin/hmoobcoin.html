        <p>Between five and six thousand years ago, the Hmong people lived in today's Hebei province. Their leader at the time was the legendary Chiyou, and his people were known as the Jiuli tribes. The ancestors of the Han Chinese, ruled by leaders Huang Di and Yan Di, lived to the northwest of the Jiuli Kingdom. As Chinese population grew, they expanded southward into Hmong territory. A major war broke out between the two sides on the northwestern part of modern-day Beijing. According to legends and folk songs, "the Hmong won nine battles but lost on the tenth."
        As the Hmong scattered towards southeast of China, they separated into multiple factions. Mainly the language and clothing changed among the group. Legend has it that a very wise and cunning woman among a large group of Hmong advised the brothers and men to change their Hmong clothes and speak Hmong in a different way and to not admit to the Chinese Han that they are the rebellious Hmong.  This strategy evaded the capture and destruction of this group of Hmong and they later flourished calling themselves White Hmong. White symbolizing purity and innocence. Due to the wisdom of the sister that saved so many of her brothers’ lives, she is still revered today.  This can be seen in modern Hmong funeral rituals where the sister is the most important entity within the White Hmong.
        The other group considered the original Hmong group refuse to hide from the Chinese Han and faced them on directly.  They considered themselves the defenders of freedom and truth and refuse to hide even when faced with utter destruction. This group of Hmong called themselves, Hmong Leeg, Leeg meaning “admit” in Hmong. The war continued on with King Chiyou leading his Kingdom of the Hmong into many more battles against the Chinese. Among the allies of the Chiyou were his two cousins from the two nearby kingdoms. As the war drew to a close a great battle was planned to end the war. Chiyou’s forces were to attack head on from the North while the other two cousins were to attack from the west and from the east. Chiyou did not know but the ally had been broken and the cousins had sided with the Chinese in taking Chinese princesses as brides.  As Chiyou’s forces attacked they looked out for their allies for reinforcement but the reinforcement never came.  That fateful day the Great King Chiyou of the Hmong was conquered. King Chiyou was tortured and killed with his body cut into 3 pieces.  His head was sent to the North, the body was sent the west and the legs sent to the east as a warning for all that defy the Chinese Han. The Hmong was hunted and had nowhere to go but south. Many later resettled in Southeast Asia, mainly Vietnam and Laos.
