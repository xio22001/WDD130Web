        <p>The Hmong wanted a life free from wars and contentions and valued peace over all things.  For this reason they stayed in the mountains and lived simple farming lives.  They however are not afraid to take up arms to fight against threat to freedom. In the 1960â€™s the United States recruited the Hmong to fight against the communist North Vietnamese. They were the forgotten heroes that sacrificed themselves to rescue American soldiers. They eventually did not win their freedom but became refugees as a result.  Displaced from their homes in Laos in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, where many Hmong fought the North Vietnamese or provided the U.S. with intelligence information, approximately 260,00 Hmong now live in the United States.
        Today, the Hmong community in the United States is centered primarily in Fresno and Sacramento, California, Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota; and Wassau, Wisconsin.  Though relatively small in number, the Hmong offer an outsize cultural richness, which can be explored at festivals, museums and cultural centers. Here at Hmong World, we seek to unite the Hmong from across the world in all areas relating to the Hmong and our culture. Welcome to Hmong World.

        <p>Hmong Land is the virtual land of the Hmong and anyone can access it through any VR headset. In Hmong Land, you can experience what it was like to live in the old traditional Hmong way. See the bamboo trees and witness the sun setting over beautiful green mountain tops. You can hike along a dirt path going up the hill and then as you look down, your eyes will swell with joy as you witness the beautiful green rice fields slightly bending against the gently blowing wind. 
            Welcome to Hmong Land. </p>
